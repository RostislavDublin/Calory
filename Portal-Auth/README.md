The Bearer authentication scheme is dedicated to the authentication using a token and is described by the RFC6750. Even if this scheme comes from an OAuth2 specification, you can still use it in any other context where tokens are exchange between a client and a server.
Concerning the JWT authentication and as it is a token, the best choice is the Bearer authentication scheme.
